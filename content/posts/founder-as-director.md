There's a mental model I keep coming back to: the founder as a film director.

A director doesn't operate the camera, design the costumes, or edit the footage. They hold the vision, make the calls, and orchestrate specialists toward a shared outcome. They're not less capable than the people they direct; they're operating at a different level of abstraction.

I think this is the right frame for what's happening to founders right now.

## The old model is breaking

For the past decade, "technical co-founder" was shorthand for "the person who can build the thing." Non-technical founders needed to either learn to code, find a co-founder who could, or raise enough money to hire one.

That bottleneck is collapsing.

Not because coding got easier. It got faster and more agentic. You don't need to write the implementation; you need to know what to build, why, and whether what's been built is right. That's a different skill set.

## What the director model actually looks like

In practice, it means:

- Writing clear, testable requirements instead of code
- Reviewing agent output for correctness and fit, not just functionality
- Shipping feedback loops so AI can iterate rather than asking humans to
- Keeping the strategic thread while agents handle execution sprints

The founders I see winning with this model aren't the ones who know the most about AI. They're the ones with the clearest sense of what they're building and why, and enough taste to recognize when something is wrong.

## Taste is the new bottleneck

When execution becomes cheap and fast, judgment becomes the constraint. What's the right product? The right market? The right sequence of features?

Those questions were always the hard ones. They're just more visibly the hard ones now.

The best directors aren't just technically competent. They have a point of view. They know what the scene needs to feel like before they've shot it. The best AI-native founders are developing the same thing: a conviction about what they're building that survives the ambiguity of early-stage work.

That's what I'm trying to build toward with Habitat and Habitat Skills, not just faster tools, but a way of working that makes founders more themselves, not less.

If you want a structured way to practice this model, Habitat runs [community hackathons](https://www.joinhabitat.eu/) where founders ship MVPs together, and [Habitat Skills](https://skills.joinhabitat.eu) gives you the AI-native operating system to keep directing once the weekend is over. For more about how I think about this, you can also read the overview on my [about page](/about).
